# RoutePlanning
How to start the program:
1. Execute RRT.lsp
2. Variable "path" is a list of point, which mark the path between the start and the goal
3. Execute "(draw-robot-path path)" in AutoCAD terminal
4. Keep pressing enter until all the steps are finished

Manipulatable parameters:
In function rrt-wrapper you are able to chose starting point, goal point and three parameters of the RRT algorithm. They are the number of itterations (which corresponds to the number of points generated by the algorithm IMPORTANT: the number of itterations corresponds to all points generated - both valid and not valid. Not valid points are not going to be added to the tree!), delta (the maximum distance between two points) and the "hand" of the robotic arm.
